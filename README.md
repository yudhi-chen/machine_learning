## 2022-01-18: Monte Carlo simulation - Job Selection Thought
This is the code to help our decision making given we have few things to consider, weightage each aspect, and put a score on each. We use Monte Carlo method to simulate how people would value each aspect in a case that many people would have come across: job selection thought process. It is high likely people in the workforce had this dilema over the job they have been nominated after substantial effort of job hunting. We narrow it down into few aspect: Work, Salary, Career Advancement, Job Security, and Work Life Balance, put a weight percentage on each aspect, then apply score in range to represent how would people value that. The simulation was performed 10,000 times, like we ask 10,000 people to help us to select which job are more promising.
